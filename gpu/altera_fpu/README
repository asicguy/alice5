These files were generated using the Quartus IP Wizard, and then
converted to Verilator-compatible Verilog using verilator_support Perl scripts
from https://github.com/twosigma/verilator_support.git .

The sqrt support files were generated as follows:
    altera_lib_lpm.pl . $(GENERATED_VERILOG)/fp_sqrt.v

The fp_sqrt.v file was generated by Quartus IP Wizard and is a project-specific name.
